# Wrestling Universe

## Project Description
Our platform offers a complete experience inspired by the WWE Universe mode, designed for every user to manage their own wrestling world in a dynamic, customizable, and intuitive way. From managing wrestlers to setting up events and rivalries, the system is built to continuously evolve and expand (some features are still in development).

**Key Features:**
* **Settings:** Customize your experience by selecting the language, light/dark mode, adjusting music and sound effects volume, toggling intergender matches, and managing your account/session.
* **Jukebox:** Access all available songs on the platform. Create custom playlists (minimum one song), shuffle your selections, or instantly play any track directly from the Jukebox view without adding it to a playlist.
* **Minigames:** Currently featuring one available title where you choose one of 12 characters and battle the other 11 in matches up to three rounds, adding a quick, competitive challenge to the experience.
* **Admin Dashboard:** An exclusive view for administrators to manage the core content of the site. It allows creating, modifying, and deleting wrestlers, as well as assigning their theme songs.
* **Authentication:** All features are protected by user authentication. Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to the login page. The app also includes a registration view and a 404 error page to ensure complete and coherent navigation.
